# BreakOut Game

Welcome to the **BreakOut Game**, a classic arcade-style game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. This project is a  traditional brick-breaking game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The game features multiple levels, increasing difficulty, and a scoreboard to track your progress.


## How to Play

### Game Rules
- **Levels:** The game has two levels. In the first level, break all the bricks to advance to the next level. The second level introduces harder challenges.
- **Scoring:** Points are awarded for each brick broken. The scoreboard keeps track of your score and the number of lives remaining.
